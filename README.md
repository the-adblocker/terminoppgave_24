### The general idea

You log onto a pc that isn't yours to find a little slick guy, who is stuck at the desktop. He wants your help, either to get out of there or to get further into the files.
The adventure (not quite) will take you into different folders to find keys, folders, a pirating site, various weaponry and more. Examples of thing you might get is a crowbar to find something hidden behind planks, and a shotgun to break boxes (and more).

### This that you see above was the original project idea 
However, due to lack of knowledge needed, horrible planning, and a general lack of motivation over the last few *months*, the product is a mere shell of what  i had originally intended.
<br>
The Product is missing some key parts of the task, including but not limited to infrastructure, web availability and databases.
<br>
So wheter or not, it is concidered any good is beyond me, but while working on this project, my motivation got rebuilt a bit.
Working with python for the first time in a long while and being able to provide some art and assets has made me want to work more.
<br>
This was something very fun to work on.
