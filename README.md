### The general idea

You log onto a pc that isn't yours to find a little slick guy, who is stuck at the desktop. He wants your help, either to get out of there or to get further into the files.
The adventure (not quite) will take you into different folders to find keys, folders, a pirating site, various weaponry and more. Examples of thing you might get is a crowbar to find something hidden behind planks, and a shotgun to break boxes (and more).

### This that you see above was the original project idea 
However, due to lack of knowledge needed, horrible planning, and a general lack of motivation over the last few *months*, the product is a mere shell of what  i had originally intended.

The Product is missing some key parts of the task, including but not limited to infrastructure, web accesabillity and databases
