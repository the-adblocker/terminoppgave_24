### The general idea

You log onto a pc that isn't yours to find a little slick guy, who is stuck at the desktop. He wants your help, either to get out of there or to get further into the files.
The adventure (not quite) will take you into different folders to find keys, folders, a pirating site, various weaponry and more. Examples of thing you might get is a crowbar to find something hidden behind planks, and a shotgun to break boxes (and more).

### problems
#### I don't know what to make it into
#### I was thinking maybe something in web? Maybe JS? Or perhaps i should do something in Godot? I have very minimal experience with either.
